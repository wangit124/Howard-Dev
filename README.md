# Howard Dev

My personal porfolio Website showcasing about me, career history, projects, resume, and a mini analytics click / view tracking dashboard service I built with Next.js API Server & Redis Upstash. I built all the UI components from scratch with regular CSS and implemented complex animations with Framer Motion. Check out the draggable bubbles!
